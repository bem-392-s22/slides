# Design Principles of Data Analysis

.box-inv-1.medium[Why?]

--

.box-1[provides a formal mechanism to describe a data analysis]

--

.box-1[provides a language for *alignment* between data analysis *producers* and *consumers*]
---

class: title title-1

# Design Principles of Data Analysis

.box-inv-1[Prioritized qualities that are relevant to the analysis and can be observed or measured]

--

.box-inv-1[A data analyst can use these principles to guide the choice of what to use to build a data analysis]

--

.box-inv-1[A data analysis can be scored based on how well it adheres to each of these principles]

--

# Skeptical

.box-inv-1[The need for more or less skepticism in a data analysis is typically governed by outside circumstances and the context in which the analysis sits]

--

.box-inv-1[Analyses that may have large impacts or result in significant monetary costs will typically be subject to detailed scrutiny]

---

class: title title-1

# Skeptical Example

- In July 2000, the Health Effects Institute (HEI) published a reanalysis of the Harvard Six Cities Study

--

- This is a seminal air pollution study that showed significant associations between air pollution and mortality

--

- Due to the potential regulatory impact of the study, HEI commissioned an independent set of investigators to reproduce the findings and conduct a series of sensitivity analyses

--

- The result was a nearly 300 page volume where the data and findings were subject to intense skepticism and every alternative hypothesis was examined

---

class: title title-1

# (Not) Skeptical Example 

- There are other instances when skepticism in the form of alternate explanations is not warranted in the analysis.

--

- A large clinical trial studying the effect of a pest management intervention on asthma outcomes, the reported analysis is ultimately a simple comparison of asthma symptoms in two groups

--

-  Such an analysis is acceptable here due to the strict pre-specification of the analysis and due to the standards and practices that the community has developed regarding the reporting of clinical trials

# Second Order

<br>

.box-inv-1[An analysis is *second-order* if it includes methods, tooling or workflows that do not directly address the primary question, but give important context or supporting information to the analysis]


---

class: title title-1

# Second Order Example

- In presenting an analysis of data collected from a new type of machine, one may include details of who manufactured the machine, why it was built, or how it operates

--

- Often, in studies where data are collected in the field, such as in peopleâ€™s homes, field workers can relay important details about the circumstances under which the data were collected

<br>

.box-inv-1[Analyses with *clarity* summarize or visualize data in a way that is influential in explaining how the underlying data phenomena or data-generation process connects to any key output, results, or conclusions]
